retraction when there are too many edges in vicinity is a problem
but transition between edges is quite smooth
need to work on retract more, particularly when edges change during mplast and mpcurrent

working but maybe corners can be handled better..so write two functions..
distance between edge and reflex, reflex and reflex, and footprint of reflex and rflex and edge and edge"
check ka and kha
paper writing to devise new algorithm for finding footprint
as on 1st Feb:
still few errors where several corners are present..we need to check letter B
and then we can find
as on 2nd Feb:
#most of the bugs removed
need to handle the case where both the edges transition simultaneously
